     * Dispatches an action creator to the store. Action creators are functions that generate
     * actions. They are called by the store and receive the current state of the application
     * and a reference to the store as their input.
     *
     * Based on that input the action creator can either return an action or not. Alternatively
     * the action creator can also perform an asynchronous operation and dispatch a new action
     * at the end of it.
     *
     * Example of an action creator:
     * <pre>
     * <code>
     * func deleteNote(noteID: Int) -> ActionCreator {
     *     return { state, store in
     *         // only delete note if editing is enabled
     *         if (state.editingEnabled == true) {
     *             return NoteDataAction.DeleteNote(noteID)
     *         } else {
     *             return nil
     *         }
     *      }
     * }
     * </code>
     * </pre>
     *
     * This action creator can then be dispatched as following:
     * <pre>
     * <code>
     * store.dispatch( noteActionCreatore.deleteNote(3) )
     * </code>
     * </pre>
     *
     * @return: By default returns the dispatched action, but middlewares can change the
     * return type, e.g. to return promises
